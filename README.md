# Tic Tac Toe

The "Tic Tac Toe" application is similar to the traditional 'tic tac toe' game but has some more features like:
* Supports 2-5 players, alternating games between plays (playing always 1v1).
* Players can choose their avatar.
* Undo/redo plays.
* Multiple sequence size.

This is just a personal project (with some problems and bugs) to allow me to practice concepts like 
Java Swing, MVC, design patterns, ...
